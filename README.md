AI Meeting Summarizer & Scheduler

An AI-powered web application that transforms online meetings into clear summaries, actionable tasks, and smart schedules.
Built to reduce post-meeting confusion and help users turn conversations into execution.

Overview

Meetings often end with unclear outcomes, forgotten tasks, and no structured follow-up.
This project solves that problem by automatically:

Summarizing meeting conversations

Extracting key decisions and action items

Scheduling tasks based on meeting context

The application is designed as a modern SaaS-style product using Next.js (App Router) with a clean, scalable frontend architecture.
